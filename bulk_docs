The attribute SQL_ATTR_PARAMSET_SIZE in ODBC is crucial when performing batch operations (like bulk inserts) because it defines how many sets of parameters will be processed in a single execution of SQLExecute.

What Is SQL_ATTR_PARAMSET_SIZE?
Purpose: It specifies the number of parameter sets in your arrays that will be executed as a batch.
Effect: When you set this attribute, ODBC understands that the bound arrays contain multiple rows of data, and SQLExecute should process all these rows in one call.
How It Works Together with SQL_ATTR_ROW_ARRAY_SIZE
SQL_ATTR_ROW_ARRAY_SIZE: Specifies the number of rows fetched in a single call to SQLFetch.
SQL_ATTR_PARAMSET_SIZE: Specifies the number of parameter sets (i.e., rows) to insert in a single call to SQLExecute.
When performing bulk inserts:

Parameter Binding: You bind your data using arrays, where each element in the array corresponds to a value for a row.
Setting Attributes:
SQL_ATTR_PARAMSET_SIZE tells the driver how many rows of data are in those arrays.
SQL_ATTR_ROW_ARRAY_SIZE is used primarily for fetching data, not inserting.
